      <p>
        I have written these vanilla webcomponents to help with getting basic website and webapplication
        functionality with ease without any framework.

      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>
        My goal is to make the life of fullstack webapplication developers easier by providing a lot
        of things out-of-the-box so they can focus on the business logic and add value instantly.
